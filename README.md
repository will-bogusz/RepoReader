## Overview

This project introduces a novel translation mechanism specifically designed for embedding codebases within Python, enabling large language models such as OpenAI's GPT-4 to semantically search and interpret source code from various programming languages.

## Features

- **Semantic Translation:** Independently researched and designed an intermediary process that translates code into English-readable commands.
- **Enhanced Vectorization:** The translation facilitates the vectorization process, allowing for contextual critical thinking and improved code retrieval accuracy.
- **ChromaDB Integration:** Integrated with an open-source document loader that utilizes ChromaDB for optimized retrieval-augmented generation.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A React and ViteJS front end has been designed and implemented to streamline user interaction, making it easier to understand and leverage GitHub repositories.
